## Use path hashes of parameters instead of custom build property
<!--
type: bugfix
scope: all
affected: all
-->

The `path_hashes` hve been extracted from the `CustomBuildPropertiesAction` of a job. This value was no longer updated and thereby causing mismatching builds for all builds since the last update of the build property.
With this fix the `path_hashes` are extraced the same way as all other build parameters. This now finds matching builds again
