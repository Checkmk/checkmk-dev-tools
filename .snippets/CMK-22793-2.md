## Add retry for remote end closed connection without response to await_build
<!--
type: bugfix
scope: all
affected: all
-->

The `await_build()` function is now also retrying to get a build result in the same was `download_artifacts()` does since `v0.4.4`.

The retry is only done 3 times for the same request terminating with a `ConnectionError`.
