## Do not overwrite build parameters by an older InfluxDB entry
<!--

During high load situations on Jenkins the job parameter of a build can not be extracted properly by the Groovy code. The iterator will fall back to default values like `null` or `false` and post these to the InfluxDB.

When iterating over the entries of an InfluxDB query the latest entry is processed first, see CMK-26742 and release `1.0.1`. The `Build` object is populated with the correct Jenkins job parameters of the `SUCCESS` entry and overwritten to `null` or `false` on the second iteration while processing the `RUNNING` entry.

This change fixes this specific Jenkins load issue by not overwriting the parameters of `Build` when processing the `RUNNING` InfluxDB entry.
