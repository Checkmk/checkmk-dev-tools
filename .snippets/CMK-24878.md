## Add InfluxDB backend to ci-artifacts
<!--
type: feature

This reduces the REST API request load at Jenkins tremendously.

To use this feature the [InfluxDB Jenkins plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/influxdb) is required.

The change is fully backwards compatible and can be enabled with the
`--influxdb` argument.
