## Do not raise an issue if artifacts shall be downloaded
<!--

When downloading an artifact from a failed build, an exception like `{"err": "Fatal exception: The build we started has result=FAILURE (URL)"}` would rise.
While the exception thrown by the function `await_build` is still usefull and is evaluated by other tools to decide on a new build or not, it prevents the download of the artifact at the same time.
To mitigate this issue the function `await_build` is extended by another parameter named `download` with the default value `False`.
The new output, when using the `download` and `--no-raise` option, is `{"result": "FAILURE", "artifacts": ["results/lint.txt"]}`

This fix follows `v0.13.1`
