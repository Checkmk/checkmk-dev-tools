<!--

A huge amount of requests towards the Jenkins API might lead to an overload of the Jenkins main controller and result in error messages like `Remote end closed connection without response`

This changes does
- Increase queue poll time from 1 to 30 seconds
- Increase job poll sleep time from 10 to 60 seconds
