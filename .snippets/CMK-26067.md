## Always return a valid JSON output on error
<!--
type: bugfix

With this fix a valid JSON value is always returned on a error.
Previously the returned value was the printed exception thrown by `raise Fatal()`. The output looked like `The build we started has result=FAILURE` as an example.
The output of `ci-artifacts` calls can be captured by other tools which try to process the data and expect a JSON on success.
Errors are now printed with the logger on error level and an empty JSON is returned as value which is always processable by other tools.
