## Do not ignore the disable cache parameter during checking for existing builds
<!--
type: bugfix

This does no longer ignore the value of the job parameter `DISABLE_CACHE` when checking for existing builds. As a result a job started with `DISABLE_CACHE=true` will not be taken into account if `DISABLE_CACHE=false` is set on other jobs.
