## Do not overwrite build result with older running result
<!--
type: bugfix
scope: all
affected: all
-->

While iterating over all builds for a result of an InfluxDB query, the build result might have been overwritten by an older (in time) result. This causes the response to become `{"existing": {"result": "RUNNING", ...}}`. The consumer task would consider this job as actively running and continue with a await call. As the job already finished the awaited task would return `FAILURE` as this is the final, already known, result. Finally this `FAILURE` result would not cause a new build, but failing instantly, being caught in a somehow endless loop, without the possibility to escape other than with a new commit.
