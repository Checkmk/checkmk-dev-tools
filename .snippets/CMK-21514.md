## Ignore bool parameter FAKE_WINDOWS_ARTIFACTS in parameter check
<!--
type: bugfix

Previously boolean job parameters can not be properly checked and compared.
This leads to unused existing builds due to `('FAKE_WINDOWS_ARTIFACTS', 'false', False)`.
There is already a hardcoded ignore or skip for `DISABLE_CACHE` which was up
to now the only actually checked boolean job parameter. Other boolean job
parameters were used in the `build_params_no_check` section and thereby
actually never checked.
This change introduces a simple bool mapping to handle the values properly
and no longer retrigger new builds due to `'false'` vs `False` mismatches
