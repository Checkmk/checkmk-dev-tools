## Do not raise an error when awaiting a build or downloading an artifact of a failed build
<!--
type: bugfix
scope: all
affected: all
-->

Before this change an error like the following was raised

```json
{"err": "Fatal exception: The build we started has result=FAILURE (https://JENKINS/path/to/job/316/)"}
```

This did not allow to download may existing artifacts of a failed build with a command call like

```sh
ci-artifacts --log-level debug download path/to/job:316 --no-remove-others --base-dir=. --out-dir=tmp_artifacts
```

But these artifacts might be of interest for analysis.

With this change the hard error is removed and the response JSON is changed to the following example in case the awaited build or the job to download artifacts has the job status as anything but success. This is now in sync with the result returned when requesting a successfully passed job.

```json
{"result": "FAILURE", "artifacts": ["results/shellcheck.txt"]}
```
