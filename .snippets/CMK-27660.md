## Skip processing the current build if a Pydantic ValidationError occurs
<!--
type: bugfix
scope: all
affected: all
-->

While iterating over all builds queried from an InfluxDB a Pydantic `ValidationError` can occur due corrupted database data or due to incomplete data being not published properly by Jenkins.
Without this change the processing would throw an Pydantic `ValidationError` and exit with a non-zero exit code.
This change wraps this step into a try-catch and logs the occurance of such an error as warning. If this build would be the matching build it will be unnecessarily retriggered, but the calling job does not fail.
