## Fall back to Jenkins API is no match is found
<!--
type: bugfix

Fall back to the Jenkins API query if no match was found by the InfluxDB query.
Previously `None` was returned if the InfluxDB connection was a success and data was queried from the InfluxDB but there was no match.
With this change additionally crawl the Jenkins API for a match to have maximum coverage and potential to find a build.
Moreover logs are provided if the pending queue is checked after no InfluxDB match was found.
