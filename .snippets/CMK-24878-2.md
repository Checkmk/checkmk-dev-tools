## Use the RUNNING state as valid build result
<!--
type: bugfix
scope: all
affected: all
-->

With this change a `RUNNING` job found in the InfluxDB result is not directly rejected and used for further checks to meet the configured constaints.
Moreover logs are provided if the pending queue is checked after no InfluxDB match was found.
